"""
Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size
groupSize, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.

Given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize, return
true if she can rearrange the cards, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
