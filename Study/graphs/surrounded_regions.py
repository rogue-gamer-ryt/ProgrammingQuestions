"""
You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically. Region: To form a region connect every 'O'
cell.

Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the
region cells are on the edge of the board. A surrounded region is captured by replacing all 'O's with 'X's in the
input matrix board.

Example 1:

Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
