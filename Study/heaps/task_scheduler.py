"""You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or
interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical
tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.



Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd
interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
