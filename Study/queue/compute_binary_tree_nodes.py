Given a binary tree, return an array consisting of the keys at the same level. Keys should appear
in the order of the corresponding nodes' depths, breaking ties from left to right. For example, you
should retum <<314>, <6,6>, <271,,561,2,271>, <28,0,3,1.,28>, <17,401.,257>, <641>> for the binary tree
