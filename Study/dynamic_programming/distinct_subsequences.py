"""
Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
