"""
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words
beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter. Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord
does not need to be in wordList. sk == endWord Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList,
return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such
sequence exists.

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
