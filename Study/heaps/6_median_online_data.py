"""
You want to compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. The sequence is presented to
you in a streaming fashion-you carmot back up to read an earlier value, and you need to output
the median after reading in each new element. For example, if the input is 1,0,3,5,2,0,1 the output
is 1,0.5,1,2,2,1.5,1

Design an algorithm for computing the running median of a sequence.

# To calculate a median you need to have a sorted array
# If odd no. of elements then median = (n + 1) / 2th element
# If even no of elements then mdedian = (n/2th element + (n+2)/2th element)/2

# use max and min heap to store the larger half and smaller half
# max heap for smaller half
# min heap for larger half
