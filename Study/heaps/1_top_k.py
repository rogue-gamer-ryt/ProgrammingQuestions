"""
Suppose you were asked to write a program which takes a sequence of strings presented in "streaming"
fashion: you cannot back up to read an earlier value. Your program must compute the k longest
strings in the sequence. All that is required is the k longest strings-it is not required to order these
strings.
As we Process the input, we want to track the k longest strings seen so far. Out of these k strings,
the string to be evicted when a longer string is to be added is the shortest one.
