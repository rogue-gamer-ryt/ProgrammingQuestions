"""
You are given a series of buildings that have windows facing west. The buildings are in a straight
line, and any building which is to the east of a building of equal or greater height cannot view the
sunset.

Design an algorithm that processes buildings in east-to-west order and returns the set of buildings
which view the sunset. Each building is specified by its height.
