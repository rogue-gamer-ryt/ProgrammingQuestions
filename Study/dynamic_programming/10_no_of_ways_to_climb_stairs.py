"""
Write a program which takes as inputs n andk and retums the number of ways in which you can
get to your destination. For example, if n = 4 and k = 2, there are five ways in which to get to the
destination:

- four single stair advances,
- two single stair advances followed by a double stair advance,
- a single stair advance followed by a double stair advance followed by a single stair advance,
- a double stair advance followed by two single stairs advances, and
- two double stair advances.
