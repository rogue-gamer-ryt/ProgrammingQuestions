"""
A heap contains limited information about the ordering of elements, so unlike a sorted array or a
balanced BSI naive algorithms for computing the k largest elements have a time complexity that
depends linearly on the number of elements in the collection.

Given a max-heap, represented as an array A, design an algorithm that computes the k
largest elements stored in the max-heap. You cannot modify the heap

"""

# Create another max-heap (candidates) which stores the indexs of the elements to process next
# We start from the root (viz. the largest element) and then get the max of its child and push that into 
# the newheap

# Time - O(klogk) | Space - O(k)
