# A permutation can be specified by an array P, where P[] represents the location of the element
# at i in the permutation. For example, the array (2,0,1,3) represents the permutation that maps the
# element at location 0 to location 2, the element at location 1 to location 0, the element at location 2
# to location 1, and keep the element at location 3 unchanged. A permutation can be applied to an
# array to reorder the array. For example, the permutation (2,0,1,3) applied to A = (a,b,c,d) yields
# the array (b,c,a,d).
# Given an array A of n elements and a permutation P, apply P to A.
